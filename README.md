# Deltahacks 5 Project - Triangle challenge - Food4Kids 

## About

I created this website during DeltaHacks 5 which took place on 26/27 Jan 2019. 
This website is my attempt at the Triangle Challenge : Donation Shop Webpage - Food4Kids 
with the Original Problem statement below :

>Food4Kids is looking for a webpage that will offer donors the ability to purchase specific items that will go into bags for the children to receive. Ideally this will be one page that acts as a grocery store for donors to pick and choose their items.  

It's my first time solving a real-world problem using Web Development, which was really fun to play around!
Since I wanted to experiment, I tried to make it from the ground.
